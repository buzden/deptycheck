# Chapter 5: Generator Emptiness

In the [previous chapter](04_primitive_imperative_language__pil__examples_.md), we witnessed something extraordinary: `DepTyCheck` generating entire, valid programs from a set of type-level rules. This works because the generator intelligently navigates the program's state to ensure every step is valid.

But what happens when a step is *impossible*? What if we ask for a program that can't exist, or a value that can't be constructed? How does a generator communicate that its recipe has led to a dead end? This chapter introduces **Generator Emptiness**, the concept that acts as a crucial guarantee for our test data recipes.

### The Impossible Request

In property-based testing, we want to generate a wide variety of data. But some "varieties" of data are simply impossible to create. The classic example in dependent types is `Fin 0`.

*   `Fin n` is the type of natural numbers that are less than `n`.
*   `Fin 3` has three possible values: `0`, `1`, and `2`.
*   `Fin 1` has one possible value: `0`.
*   `Fin 0` has **zero** possible values. There is no natural number that is less than 0.

The type `Fin 0` is called **uninhabited**. It's a perfectly valid type, but no value of that type can ever exist.

Now, imagine we write a generator function that takes a number `n` and tries to produce a `Fin n`. What should `genFin 0` do? It can't produce a value. It must fail. This is the problem that Emptiness solves.

### A Tale of Two Cookie Jars

Think of a test data generator (`Gen`) as a recipe for getting a cookie.

1.  **The Guaranteed Cookie Jar (`NonEmpty`):** This jar is magical. You know for a fact that it is always full. When you reach in, you are **guaranteed** to get a cookie, every single time.
2.  **The Mystery Cookie Jar (`MaybeEmpty`):** This jar is normal. It *might* have cookies, but it also might be empty. When you reach in, you might get a cookie, or you might find nothing but crumbs.

In `DepTyCheck`, every generator is tagged as either `NonEmpty` or `MaybeEmpty`. This isn't just a comment; it's a promise that the Idris type system checks and enforces.

*   `Gen NonEmpty a`: A recipe that is **guaranteed** to produce a value of type `a`.
*   `Gen MaybeEmpty a`: A recipe that **might** produce a value of type `a`, or it might "fail" and produce nothing.

This tag is called the `Emptiness` of the generator.

### Emptiness in Action

Let's see how our `genFin` function uses this. It needs to handle both the `Fin 3` case (guaranteed success) and the `Fin 0` case (guaranteed failure).

```idris
-- From Chapter 1
import Data.Fin

-- A generator that might fail.
genFin : (n : Nat) -> Gen MaybeEmpty (Fin n)
genFin Z     = empty
genFin (S k) = elements (allFins k)
```

Let's break this down:
*   The function signature promises to return a `Gen MaybeEmpty (Fin n)`. It's a "mystery cookie jar" because one of its branches might be empty.
*   `genFin Z`: This is the `Fin 0` case. It returns `empty`, which is the special generator that always fails. It's an empty cookie jar. It has the type `Gen MaybeEmpty a`.
*   `genFin (S k)`: This handles all non-zero cases (`Fin 1`, `Fin 2`, etc.). It uses `elements`, which is `NonEmpty` because it's guaranteed to pick from the list.

Even though the `S k` branch creates a `NonEmpty` generator, the function's overall return type *must* be `Gen MaybeEmpty` to accommodate the `Z` branch. The type system correctly identifies that if one path can fail, the entire recipe is no longer a 100% guarantee.

### Combining Generators and Emptiness

The type system automatically calculates the emptiness of combined generators. The rule is simple: **if any part of your recipe *might* be empty, the whole recipe *might* be empty.**

*   `NonEmpty` + `NonEmpty` = `NonEmpty` (Two guarantees make a guarantee)
*   `NonEmpty` + `MaybeEmpty` = `MaybeEmpty` (One risk makes the whole thing risky)

Let's see this in code. We'll create a `NonEmpty` generator for names and a `MaybeEmpty` one for optional nicknames.

```idris
-- A guaranteed generator for a name
genName : Gen NonEmpty String
genName = elements ["Alice", "Bob"]

-- A generator for a nickname that might not produce one
genNickname : Gen MaybeEmpty String
genNickname = oneOf [elements ["Ali", "Bobby"], empty]
```
If we combine these to generate a pair `(String, String)`, the resulting generator must be `MaybeEmpty`.

```idris
genNameAndNickname : Gen MaybeEmpty (String, String)
genNameAndNickname = do
  name <- genName         -- This is NonEmpty
  nick <- genNickname     -- This is MaybeEmpty
  pure (name, nick)
```
The Idris compiler sees that `genNickname` could fail. Because of that, the entire `do` block is considered `MaybeEmpty`. If `genNickname` returns `empty`, the whole generation process fails at that step.

### Under the Hood: The Emptiness Tag

The magic that makes this work is a simple data type and a crucial design choice in `Gen` itself.

First, in [`src/Test/DepTyCheck/Gen/Emptiness.idr`](../../src/Test/DepTyCheck/Gen/Emptiness.idr), we define the `Emptiness` tag:

```idris
public export
data Emptiness = NonEmpty | MaybeEmpty
```
This is just a simple marker. The real enforcement happens in the definition of the [Test Data Generator (`Gen`)](01_test_data_generator___gen___.md) itself, found in [`src/Test/DepTyCheck/Gen.idr`](../../src/Test/DepTyCheck/Gen.idr):

```idris
-- A simplified view
data Gen : Emptiness -> Type -> Type where
  Empty : Gen MaybeEmpty a
  Pure  : a -> Gen em a
  -- ... other constructors
```
Notice the `Empty` constructor. Its type signature is `Gen MaybeEmpty a`. This means you can *only* create an `Empty` generator if you explicitly mark it as `MaybeEmpty`. You cannot create a `Gen NonEmpty a` using the `Empty` constructor. This is the cornerstone of the whole guarantee system.

At compile time, the Idris type checker acts like a strict safety inspector, checking the emptiness tags of all the generator "ingredients" you use.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Programmer
    participant TC as Idris Type Checker
    participant genMaybe as genNickname (Gen MaybeEmpty String)
    participant genNon as genName (Gen NonEmpty String)
    participant Bind as (>>=) Operator

    P->>TC: Check this code: `do name <- genName; nick <- genNickname; ...`
    TC->>genNon: What is your Emptiness?
    genNon-->>TC: I am `NonEmpty`.
    TC->>Bind: Can I bind a `NonEmpty` generator?
    Bind-->>TC: Yes. The result so far is `NonEmpty`.
    TC->>genMaybe: What is your Emptiness?
    genMaybe-->>TC: I am `MaybeEmpty`.
    TC->>Bind: The next step is a bind with a `MaybeEmpty` generator. What is the final Emptiness?
    Bind-->>TC: My rule says: `... -> Gen (min lem rem) b`. `min NonEmpty MaybeEmpty` is `MaybeEmpty`. The final result must be `MaybeEmpty`.
    TC->>P: Your code is correct if the result type is `Gen MaybeEmpty ...`.
```

This compile-time analysis is what makes `DepTyCheck` so powerful. It doesn't wait until your tests are running to discover an impossible generation path; it warns you about potential failures through the type system.

This is especially critical for [Automatic Generator Derivation (`deriveGen`)](02_automatic_generator_derivation___derivegen___.md). When `deriveGen` analyzes a complex dependent type, it explores many potential ways to construct a value. If it hits an uninhabited branch (like trying to create a `Fin 0`), it knows that this path results in an `empty` generator. It can then discard that path and try another one, all without generating any faulty code.

### What's Next?

You now understand the crucial role of `Generator Emptiness`. It's the type system's way of distinguishing between recipes that are guaranteed to work and those that might lead to a dead end. This concept is a fundamental piece of the `DepTyCheck` puzzle.

So far, we've explored the building blocks (`Gen`), the automation (`deriveGen`), and the safety guarantees (`Emptiness`). But how do these pieces fit together inside the `deriveGen` "robot chef"? In the next chapter, we'll take a tour of [The Derivation Pipeline](06_the_derivation_pipeline_.md) to see the step-by-step process of turning a type into a test data generator.
