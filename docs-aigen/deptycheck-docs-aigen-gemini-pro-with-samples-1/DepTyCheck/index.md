# Tutorial: DepTyCheck

`DepTyCheck` is a property-based testing library for the Idris 2 programming language, designed to work with advanced, dependently-typed data structures.

Its main feature is **automatic generator derivation**. Instead of manually writing code to create complex test data, you can use the `deriveGen` macro. This powerful tool acts like a "robot chef" that analyzes the type of data you need and *writes the test data generator for you* at compile-time. This is especially useful for testing applications like compilers or interpreters, where you can automatically generate a stream of valid, well-typed programs to test against. The core building block is the `Gen` type, which represents a recipe for generating random data.
