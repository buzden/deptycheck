# Tutorial: DepTyCheck

`DepTyCheck` is a library for *property-based testing* in the Idris programming language, which is special because it supports **dependent types**. The core of the library is the `Gen` abstraction, a "recipe" for creating random test data. Its main superpower is `deriveGen`, a feature that can **automatically create** these complex recipes for your data structures, making it much easier to write thorough tests. It also includes tools to track whether a generator can even produce a value and to analyze how well your tests cover all parts of your data model.
