# Tutorial: DepTyCheck

DepTyCheck is a library for the Idris programming language that makes *property-based testing* much easier. Its main feature is a powerful tool, `deriveGen`, that can **automatically create random data generators** for even the most complex, *dependently-typed* data structures. This saves developers from the difficult and error-prone task of writing these generators by hand, allowing them to test their code with a wide variety of valid, randomly-generated inputs.
