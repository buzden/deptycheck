# Tutorial: DepTyCheck

This project is an Idris 2 library for *property-based testing* with a special focus on **dependent types**.
Its main feature is the ability to automatically **derive** test data *generators* (`Gen`) for complex data types using a macro called `deriveGen`.
This saves developers from writing a lot of boilerplate code for creating random, valid test inputs.
