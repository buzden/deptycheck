# Tutorial: code_to_analyze

This project is an **advanced property-based testing framework** for Idris 2 that automatically *derives generators* for custom data types, including complex dependent and recursive types. At its core is the `Gen` monad (Abstraction 0), which acts like a **random data factory** with precise emptiness control. Key innovations include:
- **Metaprogramming-driven derivation** (Abstraction 1) that analyzes type definitions
- **Coverage tracking** (Abstraction 4) to audit which types/constructors are tested
- Specialized handling of **recursive types** (Abstraction 5) via fuel consumption and probability weights
Utilities like argument permutation (Abstraction 3) and signature analysis (Abstraction 2) support these features.
