# Tutorial: DepTyCheck

`DepTyCheck` is a library for property-based testing in the Idris 2 programming language, specifically designed to handle complex *dependent types*. Its main feature is the ability to **automatically derive** test data generators. Users define the shape of their data, and the library's `deriveGen` macro writes the code to produce random, valid instances of that data. It provides a core `Gen` abstraction for representing these *data generation recipes* which can be composed manually or derived automatically.
