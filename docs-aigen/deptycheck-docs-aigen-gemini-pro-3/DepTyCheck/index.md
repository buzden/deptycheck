# Tutorial: DepTyCheck

DepTyCheck is an Idris 2 library for **property-based testing**, a powerful way to find bugs by testing your code with lots of random data. Its central feature is the *test data generator* (`Gen`), which is like a recipe for creating this random data. What makes DepTyCheck special is its ability to **automatically write these recipes for you**, even for the very complex and dependent types that Idris is famous for, saving you from a lot of tedious manual work.
