# Tutorial: DepTyCheck

DepTyCheck is a library for the Idris programming language that supercharges *property-based testing*. Its main purpose is to tackle the challenge of testing software that uses complex, rule-filled data structures, known as **dependently-typed data**. The library's core feature, `deriveGen`, acts like a smart assistant that **automatically writes test data generators** for these intricate types just by analyzing their definitions. This saves developers from the difficult and error-prone task of creating valid test cases by hand. To ensure high-quality testing, it also provides tools to analyze *test coverage* and check for biases in the *randomness* of the generated data.
