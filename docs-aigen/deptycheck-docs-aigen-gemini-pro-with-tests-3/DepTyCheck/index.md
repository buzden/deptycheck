# Tutorial: DepTyCheck

`DepTyCheck` is a library for property-based testing in the Idris 2 programming language, which supports *dependent types*.
Its main feature is the ability to **automatically create** test data generators for your custom data types, even very complex ones. Instead of manually writing code to generate random values, you can just ask `DepTyCheck` to *derive* a generator for you, which makes testing much easier and less error-prone.
