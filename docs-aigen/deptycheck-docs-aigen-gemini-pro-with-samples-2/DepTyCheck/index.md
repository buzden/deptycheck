# Tutorial: DepTyCheck

`DepTyCheck` is a library for *property-based testing* in the Idris programming language, which uses **dependent types**. Its flagship feature is `deriveGen`, a function that can *automatically* create random data generators for even the most complex, dependently-typed data structures. This means you can define data with strict, compile-time rules, and `DepTyCheck` will magically figure out how to generate valid test examples, saving you from writing complicated generator code by hand.
