# Tutorial: DepTyCheck

`DepTyCheck` is a library for the **Idris 2** programming language that makes *property-based testing* much easier. Its main purpose is to **automatically create** test data generators for even the most complex data structures, especially those using *dependent types*. Instead of manually writing code to generate valid test examples, you can simply ask the library to `deriveGen`, and it will intelligently build a correct generator for you.
