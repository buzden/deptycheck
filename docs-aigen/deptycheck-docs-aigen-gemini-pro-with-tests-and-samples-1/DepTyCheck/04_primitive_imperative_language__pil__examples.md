# Chapter 4: Primitive Imperative Language (PIL) Examples

In the last chapter, [Chapter 3: The `Gen` Monad](03_the__gen__monad.md), we learned that `Gen` is a powerful recipe for creating random data and that we can chain these recipes together to build complex values.

Now, weâ€™re going to take that knowledge and apply it to our most ambitious example yet. We will move beyond generating simple data like lists and trees. We are going to ask `DepTyCheck` to do something that sounds like science fiction: **automatically write syntactically and semantically correct computer programs.**

### The Challenge: Teaching a Machine to Code

Imagine a very simple programming language. Even a simple one has complex rules:
1.  You must declare a variable before you can use it. (`x = 5;` is okay, `y = x;` is not if `x` isn't declared).
2.  Types must match. You can't assign a boolean value to an integer variable.
3.  Some variables might be read-only (immutable). You can't change their value after they're created.

A human programmer learns these rules. When you write code, your brain (and the compiler) constantly checks them. Now, what if we wanted to generate random, *valid* programs for testing a compiler? Writing a generator that follows all these rules by hand would be incredibly difficult. You'd essentially be re-implementing a compiler's brain inside your test generator!

This is where `DepTyCheck`'s power truly shines. We can model our programming language's rules directly in the Idris type system and then let `DepTyCheck` do the heavy lifting.

### The Blueprint: A Language Defined by Types

Let's look at a "Primitive Imperative Language" (or PIL), as seen in the `DepTyCheck` examples. We won't look at the whole thing, just a few key pieces that show how the rules are encoded.

**1. The Types of our Language**
First, our simple language only has two types: integers and booleans.

```idris
-- From `examples/pil-fun/src/Language/PilFun.idr`
data Ty = Int' | Bool'
```
This is the easy part. `Int'` represents an integer and `Bool'` represents a boolean.

**2. The Context: Keeping Track of Variables**
To check rules like "variable must be declared," our types need to know what variables exist. We'll use a `Vars` type (which is a list-like structure) to represent the "context" of all variables in scope, along with their types and mutability (`Mutable` or `Immutable`).

**3. The Expressions: Building Blocks with Rules**
An `Expr` is something that evaluates to a value, like a constant (`5`), a variable (`x`), or a function call. The type for `Expr` is the amazing part:

```idris
-- A simplified version of Expr
data Expr : (vars : Vars) -> (ty : Ty) -> Type where
  C : Literal ty -> Expr vars ty
  V : (n : IndexIn vars) ->
      AtIndex n ty mut =>
      Expr vars ty
```

Let's break down this blueprint:
*   `Expr vars ty`: This says, "An `Expr` is defined in the context of some `vars`, and it will produce a value of type `ty`."
*   `C`: The `C`onstant constructor. This lets us create an expression like `5` (which has type `Int'`) or `True` (type `Bool'`).
*   `V`: The `V`ariable constructor. This is where the magic is! To use a variable, you need two things:
    *   `n : IndexIn vars`: A "proof" that the variable exists in our context `vars`.
    *   `AtIndex n ty mut =>`: A "proof" that the variable at that index has a specific `ty`pe and `mut`ability.

The type system itself forbids you from creating an `Expr` that refers to a variable that doesn't exist. If you try, the compiler will say, "You can't give me a proof that this variable exists!"

**4. The Statements: Writing the Program**
A `Stmt` (statement) is an action, like declaring a new variable or assigning a value to an existing one. Look how the rules for assignment are encoded in the type:

```idris
-- A simplified version of Stmts
data Stmts : (vars : Vars) -> Type where
  Assign : (n : IndexIn vars) ->
           AtIndex n ty Mutable =>
           (val : Expr vars ty) ->
           Stmts vars ->
           Stmts vars
```

This `Assign` constructor models an assignment like `x = 5;`.
*   `n : IndexIn vars`: You must prove which variable you are assigning to.
*   `AtIndex n ty Mutable =>`: The type system enforces a critical rule: you can only assign to a variable that is `Mutable`. If you try to assign to an immutable one, you won't be able to provide this proof.
*   `val : Expr vars ty`: The value you're assigning (`val`) must be an expression that has the *exact same type* `ty` as the variable. This prevents you from assigning a `Bool'` to an `Int'`.

We have successfully encoded the rules of our programming language directly into the Idris type system!

### Let `DepTyCheck` Be the Programmer

Now for the payoff. We have this incredibly complex and rule-bound blueprint (`Stmts`). How do we generate valid programs? We just ask `DepTyCheck`.

First, we define the signature for our program generator. It will take some `Fuel` and the initial context (for example, an empty list of variables) and produce a `Gen` for a `Stmts`.

```idris
-- From `examples/pil-fun/src/Main.idr`
genProgram : Fuel -> Gen MaybeEmpty (Stmts Lin Nothing)
```
*   `Stmts Lin Nothing`: This means "generate a sequence of statements, starting with an empty context (`Lin`) and no return value expected (`Nothing`)."

And the implementation is... you guessed it.

```idris
genProgram = deriveGen
```

That's it. We're done. When the compiler sees this, `DepTyCheck` kicks in, reads the blueprints for `Stmts`, `Expr`, `AtIndex`, and all the other related types. It untangles all the rules and constraints and automatically writes a complex generator function that knows how to:
*   Declare new variables.
*   Use only variables that are in scope.
*   Respect type-safety during assignments.
*   Only assign to mutable variables.
*   ...and so on!

The result is a generator that can produce random, but always-correct, programs in our little language.

### Under the Hood: `DepTyCheck`'s Thought Process

How does `deriveGen` figure this out? You can think of it as a logical reasoner.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You as Developer
    participant DTC as DepTyCheck (deriveGen)
    participant StmtsBP as Stmts Blueprint
    participant ExprBP as Expr Blueprint
    participant ProgGen as Generated Program Generator

    You->>DTC: Please create a generator for `Stmts`.
    DTC->>StmtsBP: I need to build `Stmts`. What are my options?
    StmtsBP-->>DTC: You can use `Assign`. But to do so, you need a mutable variable and a matching expression.
    DTC->>DTC: Okay, to use `Assign`, I first need to find a `Mutable` variable in the current context. Let's say I find `x` of type `Int'`.
    DTC->>DTC: Now I need an `Expr` of type `Int'`. How do I make one?
    DTC->>ExprBP: I need to build an `Expr` of type `Int'`. What are my options?
    ExprBP-->>DTC: You could make a constant like `5` (`C`), or you could use another variable (`V`) that is also of type `Int'`.
    DTC->>DTC: I'll make a plan: I will choose randomly. Maybe I'll pick a constant `5`.
    DTC->>ProgGen: I'm writing your logic. One possible step for you is: "Find a mutable integer variable `x`. If you find one, generate an assignment statement `x = 5;`."
```

`DepTyCheck` performs this reasoning for *every constructor* of *every data type* involved. It builds a complete "decision tree" that respects all the rules defined in the types, resulting in a smart generator that can navigate the complex state space of a well-typed program.

### Why Is This a Big Deal?

This example is a major leap because it demonstrates `DepTyCheck`'s potential in highly complex domains.

**It's like an AI that writes code snippets.** By giving it a formal grammar (the Idris types), `DepTyCheck` can generate syntactically and semantically correct examples from that grammar.

The most powerful application of this is **compiler fuzz testing**. A "fuzzer" is a tool that bombards a program with random inputs to find bugs.
*   **Bad Fuzzing:** Generating random text (`"int x = ; y z 5 &&&"`) and feeding it to a compiler. Most inputs are rejected by the parser, so only the earliest parts of the compiler are tested.
*   **Good Fuzzing with `DepTyCheck`:** Using `DepTyCheck` to generate thousands of *valid, well-typed* programs. These programs pass the parser and type-checker, allowing the fuzzer to find much deeper bugs in the compiler's optimization, analysis, or code generation phases.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we saw how `DepTyCheck` can tackle a problem far more complex than generating a sorted list. By modeling the rules of a simple programming language within the Idris type system, we transformed `DepTyCheck` into an engine capable of automatically writing correct programs.

This illustrates a profound concept: if you can describe the rules of your system in its types, `DepTyCheck` can serve as a powerful tool to generate valid instances of that system. This opens the door to advanced testing strategies like compiler fuzzing and model-based testing.

So far, we have treated `deriveGen` as a magical black box. But what if we want to understand how it makes its decisions, or even influence them? In the next chapter, we'll start opening that box.

Next up: [Chapter 5: Derivation Core & Strategy](05_derivation_core___strategy.md).
