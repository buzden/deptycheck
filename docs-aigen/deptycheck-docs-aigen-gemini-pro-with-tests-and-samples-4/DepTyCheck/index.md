# Tutorial: DepTyCheck

`DepTyCheck` is a library for *property-based testing* in Idris 2, a language with powerful dependent types. Its main feature is the ability to **automatically generate test data** for even very complex data structures. At its heart is the `Gen` abstraction, which is like a *recipe* for creating random values. The real magic is `deriveGen`, a tool that looks at your data type's definition and **writes the generation recipe for you**, saving developers from a complex and error-prone task. This makes it incredibly useful for testing things where data must follow strict, interdependent rules, like compilers or verifiers.
