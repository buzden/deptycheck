# Chapter 6: Deep Constructor Analysis

Welcome back! In [Chapter 5: Constructor Handling](05_constructor_handling_.md), we learned how DepTyCheck acts like a team of specialized factory workers, building generator handlers for each constructor. Now imagine you're an archaeologist 🧪 excavating ancient ruins. To uncover hidden treasures, you can't just look at the surface - you need to carefully dig through layers of soil and structures! DepTyCheck's **Deep Constructor Analysis** works similarly—it deeply analyzes nested constructors to handle complex dependent types! ⛏️🏺

## Why Dig Deeper?

Imagine building a system that tracks different shapes with rules like:
```idris
data ShapeKind = Circle | Square

data Shape : ShapeKind -> Type where
  CircleShape : Radius -> Shape Circle
  SquareShape : SideLength -> Shape Square
```

To generate a `Circle`, we must:
1. Know we're building for type `Shape Circle`
2. Dig into `CircleShape` to find its structure
3. Generate a `Radius` value

Deep Constructor Analysis is like archaeological excavation:
- Surface level = The top-level constructor (`Shape`)
- Deeper layers = Its nested components (`CircleShape`, `Radius`)

Without carefully excavating these layers, we'd miss important details needed for generating valid GADT instances!

## The Archaeological Dig Process

Let's see how analysis works with a simple example:
```idris
-- Create a BlueCircle with specific radius
blueCircle : Shape Circle
blueCircle = CircleShape blue 5.0
```

DepTyCheck excavates each layer:
1. Top: `CircleShape` (surface constructor)
2. Middle: `blue` (underlying color)
3. Deepest: `5.0` (radius value)

This layered analysis helps generate complete valid values!

    participant Archaeologist as Deep Analysis
    participant Layer1 as CircleShape Constructor
    participant Layer2 as Blue Color
    participant Core as Radius Value
    
    Archaeologist->>Layer1: Uncover top-level constructor
    Layer1->>Layer2: Discover color definition
    Layer2->>Core: Find radius value
    Core->>Archaeologist: Return completed structure
```

## Beginner's Example: Generating Shapes

See how automatic derivation uses deep analysis:
```idris
-- Our type definitions
data ShapeKind = Circle | Square

data Shape : ShapeKind -> Type where
  CircleShape : Double -> Shape Circle
  SquareShape : Double -> Shape Square

-- Generate shapes (magically works!)
shapeGen : (kind: ShapeKind) -> Gen (Shape kind)
shapeGen kind = deriveGen
```

When generating `Circle` shapes:
1. Deep analysis identifies `kind = Circle`
2. Locates corresponding `CircleShape` constructor
3. Generates a `Double` for the radius

All automatically through layered analysis!

## How Excavation Happens Step-By-Step

For a sample call `shapeGen Circle`, DepTyCheck performs:
1. Identify constructor: `CircleShape` (matches `Shape Circle`)
2. Analyze construction: `CircleShape {radius}`
3. Recurse: Generate `Double` for radius
4. Build: Combine into `CircleShape radiusValue`

Here's simplified code from `DeepConsApp.idr` showing this recursion:
```idris
-- Pseudocode - the core recursive analysis
deepAnalyze : Constructor -> Gen
deepAnalyze con = do
  -- Step 2: Create generators for each argument
  argGens <- forEach con.arg $ \arg => 
    deepAnalyze arg.type  -- Recurse deeper!
    
  -- Step 4: Combine into final generator
  pure $ do
    args <- combine argGens
    pure (con.build args)
```

## Solving GADT Mysteries

Deep analysis really shines with dependent types. Imagine this calendar type:
```idris
data Month = Jan | Feb | ... | Dec

data Date : (m: Month) -> Type where
  MkDate : (day: Fin 31) -> {prf: ValidDay m day} -> Date m
```

To generate a `Date Feb`:
1. Analyzes that `m = Feb`
2. Finds `MkDate` is Feb's only constructor
3. Checks valid day range (1-28/29)
4. Generates days with validity proof

The analysis handles nested layers automatically:
- Date ⟶ Month ⟶ Day ⟶ Validity proof

## Real Tomb Discovery: Dependent Car Parts

Let's analyze this complex car part inventory:
```idris
data PartType = Engine | Wheel

data CarPart : PartType -> Type where
  V8Engine : HP -> CarPart Engine
  AlloyWheel : Size -> Material -> CarPart Wheel
```

To generate for `type = Engine`:
1. Analysis looks for matching constructors (only `V8Engine`)
2. Recurses into `HP` generation
3. Builds `V8Engine $generateHP`

This solves GADT dependencies: Only engines can have horsepower!

## Your Archaeological Kit 🧭

Deep Constructor Analysis helps DepTyCheck:
1. Handle nested constructors
2. Resolve GADT indexes
3. Generate valid dependent types
4. Avoid impossible constructions (like all-engine wheels)
5. Maintain type safety through layers

Just like an archaeologist carefully preserves each layer of a dig site, DepTyCheck respects every layer of your type structure.
