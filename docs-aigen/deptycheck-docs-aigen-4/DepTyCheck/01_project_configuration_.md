# Chapter 1: Project Configuration

Welcome to the world of DepTyCheck! 🎉 Think of writing software like building a house. Before any construction starts, architects create blueprints that specify materials, measurements, and dependencies between different parts. In programming, **Project Configuration** is your software blueprint - it tells your tools how to build your project, what external libraries to use, and how everything connects together.  

## Why Do We Need Configuration?

Imagine you moved into a new coding workshop (your project folder). Before you build anything, you need to tell your tools:

1. **What you're building** (your project details and files)
2. **What tools you need** (dependencies like saws and hammers)
3. **How to organize things** (directory structures and style rules)

Without this blueprint, your tools wouldn't know where to look for materials or how to assemble them!

Let's explore the main configuration files DepTyCheck uses:

### 1. The Project Blueprint: `deptycheck.ipkg`

This is your main project description file. Here's a simplified version:

```idris
package deptycheck

authors = "Denis Buzdalov"
brief = "Property-based testing with dependent types"

sourcedir = "src"
builddir = ".build"

depends = ansi
        , best-alternative
        , dependent-vect
        , positive-nat
        , random-pure
```

Let's break this down:
- `package deptycheck`: The name of your project
- `authors`/`brief`: Basic project info
- `sourcedir`/`builddir`: Folder locations (source files vs build outputs)
- `depends`: All libraries your project needs to run (like tools in your workshop)

### 2. The Style Guide: `.editorconfig`

This ensures consistent formatting across your project - like workshop rules saying "all measurements in inches" or "no coffee cups near keyboards":

```editorconfig
[*]
end_of_line = lf
charset = utf-8
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
```

Key rules:
- `indent_style = space`: Use spaces for indentation
- `indent_size = 2`: Two spaces per indent level
- Applies to all files (`[*]`) by default

### 3. The Supply Manager: `pack.toml`

When your project needs external libraries, this file tells package managers like `pack` where to find them:

```toml
[custom.all.deptycheck]
type = "local"
path = "."
ipkg = "deptycheck.ipkg"

[custom.all.docs]
type = "local"
path = "docs"
ipkg = "docs.ipkg"
```

What this means:
- Each `[custom...]` section is a package
- `type = "local"`: Use code from our computer
- `path`: Location of the package
- `ipkg`: Which file defines the package (our blueprint!)

### 4. The Documentation Manual: `.readthedocs.yaml`

This configures automated documentation generators - your homeowner's manual factory:

```yaml
build:
  os: ubuntu-22.04
  tools:
    python: "3.10"

sphinx:
  configuration: docs/source/conf.py
```

This says:
- Build on Ubuntu Linux
- Use Python 3.10
- Use Sphinx documentation tools with settings from `conf.py`

## How It All Fits Together

When you run build tools, here's what happens behind the scenes:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant BuildTool
    participant Ipkg as deptycheck.ipkg
    participant Deps as Dependencies
    participant Output

    BuildTool->>Ipkg: Reads project details
    Ipkg->>Deps: Requests libraries
    Deps->>BuildTool: Provides needed tools
    BuildTool->>Output: Creates build folder
    BuildTool->>Output: Compiles project
```

1. Your build tool starts 
2. Checks `.ipkg` for instructions
3. Consults `pack.toml` for tools/supplies
4. Uses `.editorconfig` rules during building
5. Generates outputs in the `builddir`

## Real-World Example

Let's say your workshop (`src`) contains these files:
```
src/
  Builder.idr
  Inspector.idr
  SafetyTester.idr
```

When you run `idris --build deptycheck.ipkg`:
1. Tools gather `ansi`, `dependent-vect` etc. from `pack.toml`
2. Format all files with 2-space indents (per `.editorconfig`)
3. Compile everything from `src/`
4. Place results in `.build/`

## Your Project's Foundation 🏗️

Congratulations! You now understand how DepTyCheck's project configuration works. Remember:
- **deptycheck.ipkg** is your main blueprint
- **.editorconfig** is your style guide
- **pack.toml** manages dependencies
- **.readthedocs.yaml** builds documentation

These files might change names in other projects, but their roles remain similar across programming languages.
