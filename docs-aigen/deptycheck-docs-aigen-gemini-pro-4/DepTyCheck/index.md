# Tutorial: DepTyCheck

DepTyCheck is a library for *property-based testing* in the Idris 2 programming language, designed specifically to handle **dependent types**. Its main purpose is to help developers test their code by automatically creating complex test data.

The core of the library is the `Gen` abstraction, which is a blueprint for generating random values. The most powerful feature is its ability to **automatically derive** these `Gen` blueprints for sophisticated data types just by looking at their definitions. This saves developers from writing a lot of tedious, error-prone code and makes it easy to test properties of advanced data structures that are common in dependently-typed programming.
