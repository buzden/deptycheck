# Chapter 22: Git Ignore

Welcome back! In [Chapter 21: EditorConfig](21_editorconfig_.md), we learned how to keep our code looking tidy and consistent across different editors using a `.editorconfig` file. Now, we're going to dive into another important configuration file that helps keep our project clean and focused on the essential parts: **Git Ignore**.

## What Problem Does Git Ignore Solve?

Imagine you're developing a software project, and Git (your version control system) is like a super-organized librarian carefully tracking every book, every change, and every new note you add. That's great! But sometimes, you have "books" (files) that you *don't* want the librarian to track. These might be:
*   **Temporary files:** Files your editor creates for backups (like `MyFile.idr~`).
*   **Build artifacts:** Files generated when you compile your code (like `.build/` folders).
*   **Personal settings:** Files with user-specific configurations that shouldn't be shared with everyone else.
*   **Sensitive data:** Files with passwords or API keys (though these should ideally not be in your project folder at all!).

If Git tracks these unnecessary files, your repository gets bloated, it's harder to see the important changes, and you might accidentally commit sensitive information.

The problem Git Ignore solves is: **how can we tell Git to explicitly *not* track certain files and directories, keeping our version control system clean and focused only on the actual source code and project configurations?** It's like giving your super-organized librarian a special "blacklist" of items they should completely ignore.

Our central use case for this chapter is: **To tell Git in the `DepTyCheck` project to ignore temporary files, compiled output, and test-related junk, so that only the meaningful source code files are committed to the repository.**

## The `.gitignore` File: Git's Blacklist

The `.gitignore` file is a plain text file, usually located in the root directory of your Git repository. It contains patterns (like filenames or folder names) that Git should simply pretend don't exist when it's looking for changes.

Let's look at the `DepTyCheck` project's `.gitignore` file:

```
build/
.build/
**/tests/**/failures
**/tests/**/output
```

This file contains simple rules, one per line. Let's break them down:

### 1. `build/`

```
build/
```
*   This rule tells Git to ignore any directory named `build/`.
*   **Why:** When you compile Idris code (or many other programming languages), the compiler often creates a `build/` folder to store compiled files, temporary objects, and other outputs. These are generated files and shouldn't be part of your source code repository because they can be recreated from the source.

### 2. `.build/`

```
.build/
```
*   This rule is very similar to the first but specifically targets a directory named `.build/`. The dot (`.`) at the beginning usually indicates a "hidden" folder or file on Unix-like systems.
*   **Why:** For `DepTyCheck`, as we saw in [Chapter 1: DepTyCheck Idris Package](01_deptycheck_idris_package_.md), the `deptycheck.ipkg` specifies `builddir = ".build"`. This means `pack` and the Idris compiler will put all their generated build artifacts in a folder named `.build/`. We definitely don't want Git tracking these.

### 3. `**/tests/**/failures`

```
**/tests/**/failures
```
*   This rule is a bit more complex, using "glob patterns" (like wildcards) to match paths.
*   `**`: This matches zero or more directories.
*   `/tests/`: Matches a directory named `tests`.
*   `**/`: Again, matches zero or more directories.
*   `failures`: Matches any directory or file named `failures`.
*   **Why:** This pattern means "ignore any file or directory named `failures` that is inside any `tests` directory, no matter how deeply nested." When you run tests with `DepTyCheck` or other testing frameworks, they might create files or directories to log test failures. These are generated test results and don't belong in the source code.

### 4. `**/tests/**/output`

```
**/tests/**/output
```
*   This rule is identical in structure to the previous one, but it targets files or directories named `output`.
*   **Why:** Similar to `failures`, test runs often produce `output` logs or files. We want to ignore these generated outputs to keep the repository clean.

## Central Use Case in Action

Let's see how this `.gitignore` file helps keep the `DepTyCheck` project tidy.

    participant Developer as Developer
    participant Git as Git
    participant FileSystem as File System
    participant GitIgnore as .gitignore

    Developer->>FileSystem: Creates `src/MyModule.idr`
    Developer->>FileSystem: Creates `deptycheck.ipkg`
    Developer->>FileSystem: Runs `pack build`
    FileSystem->>FileSystem: Creates `.build/` directory with compiled files
    Developer->>FileSystem: Runs `pack test`
    FileSystem->>FileSystem: Creates `tests/MyTest/failures` directory

    Developer->>Git: `git status` (What files changed?)
    Git->>GitIgnore: Check `.gitignore` rules
    GitIgnore->>Git: "Ignore `.build/`"
    GitIgnore->>Git: "Ignore `**/tests/**/failures`"
    Git->>Git: (Compares FileSystem with GitIgnore)
    Git-->>Developer: "New files: `src/MyModule.idr`, `deptycheck.ipkg`
                          Ignored: `.build/`, `tests/MyTest/failures`"
    Developer->>Git: `git add src/MyModule.idr deptycheck.ipkg`
    Developer->>Git: `git commit -m "Add new module"`
    Git->>Git: (Only `src/MyModule.idr` and `deptycheck.ipkg` are committed)
```

As you can see, Git intelligently consults the `.gitignore` file every time it performs an operation that involves looking at the file system (`git status`, `git add`). This ensures that only the relevant source code and configuration files are ever considered for version control.

## More `.gitignore` Patterns (for your reference)

Here are a few other common patterns you might see in `.gitignore` files:

*   **Specific file:** `log.txt` (ignores a file named `log.txt` in the same directory as `.gitignore`)
*   **Specific file in any directory:** `*.log` (ignores any file ending with `.log` in any directory)
*   **Specific sub-directory:** `/temp` (ignores `temp` directory only if it's in the root of the repo)
*   **Exclude a pattern, then re-include an exception:**
    ```
    *.log
    !important.log
    ```
    (Ignores all `.log` files EXCEPT `important.log`) This is useful if you want to ignore most logs but keep one specific log for debugging.

## Internal Implementation: How Git Uses `.gitignore`

Git's use of `.gitignore` is straightforward:

1.  **Read Rules:** When Git needs to determine which files to track or ignore, it reads one or more `.gitignore` files.
    *   It starts with the `.gitignore` file in the current directory.
    *   It then checks `.gitignore` files in parent directories, all the way up to the root of the repository.
    *   It can also use rules from your global Git configuration (`~/.config/git/ignore` or `~/.gitignore_global`).
2.  **Match Patterns:** For every file in your working directory, Git compares its path against the patterns found in these `.gitignore` files.
    *   The rules are processed from top to bottom.
    *   Later rules override earlier rules (especially exclusion vs. re-inclusion).
    *   `!` at the beginning of a pattern re-includes a file that was previously ignored.
3.  **Filter Files:** If a file matches an ignore pattern, Git simply excludes it from its operations (like `git status` or `git add`). It treats it as if it doesn't exist in the repository's context.

It's important to remember that `.gitignore` only tells Git to ignore *untracked* files. If you've already accidentally `git add`ed and `git commit`ed a file, adding it to `.gitignore` won't untrack it. You'd need to explicitly remove it from Git's history (`git rm --cached <file>`) to stop tracking it while keeping it in your local file system.

## Conclusion

The `.gitignore` file is an essential tool for maintaining a clean and focused Git repository. By providing simple patterns, `DepTyCheck` (and any other Git-based project) can explicitly tell Git to ignore files that are temporary, automatically generated, or user-specific. This practice keeps the repository lean, improves collaboration by preventing style clashes in non-source files, and ensures that only valuable, hand-crafted code is tracked by version control.

Next, we'll look at the `To Be Done (TBD)` concept in `DepTyCheck`, which highlights unfinished parts of the project.
