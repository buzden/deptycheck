I tried to migrate in a single hop a lot of times, but didn't even manage to finish. Currently, I see the migration to be possible in the following steps:\n- [ ] Copying old pre-overhaul parts of `Language.Reflection.Types` into DepTyCheck (with permission of Stefan) and switching to them\n- [ ] Removing special fork from `pack.toml`;\n- [ ] Using modern pretty-printer from `elab-pretty` library;\n- [ ] Switching from outdated `Arg True` (aka `NamedArg`) type to moder `Arg` type and `NamedArg` predicate;\n- [ ] Moving to the modern indexed `Con` and `TypeInfo`.","files":null}]}
