Maybe, we should always make generation order in a such way that these generators only \"filter\", i.e. they always take both their generators as givens.\n\n---\n\nHowever, it is possible to derive such generators with one derived and one generated argument. It should be possible at least when `DecEq` is derivable; however I'm not sure it's feasible in a general case.\n\n---\n\nAnyway, since generators with both given arguments seems to be not really sparse, so, maybe this hard derivation is not really needed. this needs some investigation.","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1685432500,"nonce":"akkzhSXR6d1yJTrq615G2kjcayg=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOEt7lWM5nN6l3zwAAAAIuyjcp"},"added":["status: discussion"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1685432500,"nonce":"THTLsxYfVcrd17AkjW2MZS4rSqQ=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOEt7lWM5nN6l3zwAAAAIuyjc4"},"added":["part: derivation"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1685432500,"nonce":"8WEGCWHxs/LG5jdOJ+bOaZpAGGw=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOEt7lWM5nN6l3zwAAAAIuyjdE"},"added":["status: feature request"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1685432500,"nonce":"UYMmmbQiGMLJJQxg6MFNIGk7ryA=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOEt7lWM5nN6l3zwAAAAIuyjdN"},"added":["derive: least-effort"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1685432501,"nonce":"gQegjREHdXMZPELOtOGapg8VK50=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOEt7lWM5nN6l3zwAAAAIuyjdX"},"added":["derive: core"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1685432501,"nonce":"LQ1KRxT3qrFNA9bZjUs31oA0DNg=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOEt7lWM5nN6l3zwAAAAIuyjdf"},"added":["derive: entry"],"removed":[]},{"type":2,"timestamp":1685444280,"nonce":"lMHJzJzYRtnZ5NMGZFQcKGW+//E=","metadata":{"github-id":"RTE_lADOEt7lWM5nN6l3zwAAAAIu6bdb"},"title":"Manage `(l = r) -\u003e Void` fields in constructors specially","was":"Manage `(l = r) -\u003e Void` fields in constructors specially"},{"type":5,"timestamp":1711390690,"nonce":"PM8oSGLY8Yi44KAU2rcmI6WYQqg=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOEt7lWM5nN6l3zwAAAALZfDv_"},"added":["code: heuristics"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1711390712,"nonce":"AT6b8//4P4zwdyEPegpyVJfuCkY=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOEt7lWM5nN6l3zwAAAALZfEnJ"},"added":["issue: compilation error"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1711390827,"nonce":"1aqlyxlIf7qB9GRohsAbGBugtqo=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOEt7lWM5nN6l3zwAAAALZfKBj"},"added":["code: enhancement"],"removed":[]}]}
