Surely, if `Dec` returns `No`, there's no need to derive a generator (for an independent type) or to return an empty generator (for a dependent type, whose `Dec` instance contains additional arguments).","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1685432869,"nonce":"20AEQekEtUGUyPCdLeanAsV32Rk=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOEt7lWM5nN8_EzwAAAAIuy09u"},"added":["part: derivation"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1685432869,"nonce":"6RCwUX+Y5fIT6EWW6Jr7sUVZWj0=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOEt7lWM5nN8_EzwAAAAIuy097"},"added":["status: feature request"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1685432869,"nonce":"tXa/wofs3/1e+/BfTtW9HFwZCk8=","metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADOEt7lWM5nN8_EzwAAAAIuy0-K"},"added":["derive: core"],"removed":[]}]}
