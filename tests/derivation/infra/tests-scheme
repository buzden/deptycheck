`self X N`       are `empty-body X N` with `@{EmptyBody}` changed to `@{CallSelf}`
`empty-cons X N` are `empty-body X N` with `@{EmptyBody}` changed to `@{EmptyCons}`

Look types
- for *print* type: `cat empty-body\ print\ */DerivedGen.idr | grep 'print'`
- for *run* type  : `cat empty-body\ run\ */DerivedGen.idr | grep 'checkedGen : '`
