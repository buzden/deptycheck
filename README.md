A library for property-based testing with dependent types and automatic derivation of generators for Idris 2

## Status

ðŸš§ The library is under heavy construction ðŸš§

For now, it lacks most of things required for normal property-based testing,
like support for *properties* and fancy testing operations.
Also, for now we do not support such important thing as *shrinking*.

The current focus for now is on *test data generators* and *automatic derivation* of them.

## Generators

Generators in the simplest case produce a bunch of values of appropriate type:

```idris
genSomeStrings : Gen String
genSomeStrings = elements ["one", "two", "three"]
```

You can combine several generators into one:

```idris
genMoreStrings : Gen String
genMoreStrings = oneOf [genSomeStrings, elements ["more", "even more"]]
```

> **Note**
>
> All generators listed in `oneOf` are meant to be distributed uniformly between each other as a whole thing.
> That is, in `genMoreStrings` values `"one"`, `"two"` and `"three"` have the same probability to be generated
> and this probability is `2/3` of probability for `"more"` or `"even more"` to appear.

So, the following generator is **not** equivalent to the `genMoreStrings` from above:

```idris
genMoreStrings' : Gen String
genMoreStrings' = elements ["one", "two", "three", "more", "even more"]
```

In `genMoreStrings'` all values are distributed uniformly.

To achieve the same result with reusing `genSomeStrings` generator, we need to dig into it deeper with `alternativesOf` function:

```idris
genMoreStrings'' : Gen String
genMoreStrings'' = oneOf $ alternativesOf genMoreStrings ++ alternativesOf (elements ["more", "even more"])
```

> **Note**
>
> There are also functions based on the `alternativesOf`, allowing to map values from all alternatives in a single expression
> named `mapAlternativesOf` and `mapAlternativesWith`.

You can also operate with alternatives as with applicative functors or monads.

For example, consider a generator of lists with length not greater than given.
There are a lot of possible implementations, but consider a recursive one:

```idris
genListsN : Gen a -> (n : Nat) -> Gen $ List a
genListsN _    Z     = [| [] |]
genListsN genA (S n) = oneOf $ [| [] |]
                            :: [| [genA] :: alternativesOf (genListsN genA n) |]
```

Distribution of lengths of lists produced by this generator is uniform,
thanks to `alternativesOf` function.

> **Note**
>
> If we were not using `alternativesOf` at all (say, with expression `[| genA :: genListsN genA n |]`),
> probability of getting a list of length `n+1` would be 2 times *less* than getting a list of length `n`.

Generators can be combined with operations from `Applicative` interface:

```idris
data X = MkX String String

genStrPairs : Gen X
genStrPairs = [| MkX genSomeStrings genMoreStrings |]
```

> **Note**
>
> The number of alternatives acquired by `alternativesOf` function of an applicative combination
> of two generators is a product of numbers of alternatives of those generators.

Unlike, say, in QuickCheck, generators can be empty.
This is important for dependent types.
For example, `Fin 0` is not inhabited,
thus we need to have an empty generator
if we want to have a generator for any `Fin n` (and sometimes we really want):

```idris
genFin : (n : Nat) -> Gen $ Fin n
genFin Z     = empty
genFin (S n) = elements $ forget $ allFins n
```

Generators are also monads:

```idris
genAnyFin : Gen Nat => Gen (n ** Fin n)
genAnyFin @{genNat} = do
  n <- genNat
  f <- genFin n
  pure (n ** f)
```

Distribution of a generator built by monadic bind is such that
the whole continuation (i.e. RHS of `>>=`) applied to some `x` has the same probability to produce the result
as the probability for `x` to appear.

Thus, in the example above probability of particular natural `n` to come in the result
is the same as probability of this `n` to come on the given `genNat`.
After that, all fins for each particular `n` are distributed evenly, because it is a property of `genFin`.

You need to use `alternativesOf` if you want all possible resulted values to be distributed evenly, e.g.:

```idris
genAnyFin' : Gen Nat => Gen (n ** Fin n)
genAnyFin' @{genNat} = oneOf $ do
  n <- alternativesOf genNat
  f <- alternativesOf $ genFin n
  pure (n ** f)
```

Here we are using special monadic syntax support for lists of generators produced by `alternativesOf` function.

In the last example, all results of `genFin 1` and all results of `genFin 2` would **not** be distributed equally
in the case when `genNat` is `elements [1, 2]`, when they are distributed equally in the example of `genAnyFin`.
I.e., particular generator's application `genAnyFin @{elements [1, 2]}` would be equivalent to `oneOf [pure (1**0), elements [(2**0), (2**1)]]`
where `genAnyFin' @{elements [1, 2]}` would be equivalent to `elements [(1**0), (2**0), (2**1)]`.
Thus, they have the same domain, but different distributions.

<!-- idris
app_non_even, app_non_even_inlined, app_even, app_even_inlined : Gen (n ** Fin n)
app_non_even = genAnyFin @{elements [1, 2]}
app_non_even_inlined = oneOf [pure (1**0), elements [(2**0), (2**1)]]
app_even = genAnyFin' @{elements [1, 2]}
app_even_inlined = elements [(1**0), (2**0), (2**1)]
-->

Despite monadic bind of generators interprets left-hand side generators as a whole,
it looks inside it when the resulting generator is being asked for alternatives by `alternativesOf` function or its variants.

For example, `alternativesOf` being applied to `genAnyFin @{elements [1, 2]}` would produce two alternatives.
Sometimes this can be undesirable, thus, a `forgetStructure` function exists.
It allows to forget actual structure of a generator in terms of its alternatives.

Consider one more alternative of `genAnyFin`, now the given `genNat` is wrapped with `forgetStructure`:

```idris
genAnyFin'' : Gen Nat => Gen (n ** Fin n)
genAnyFin'' @{genNat} = do
  n <- forgetStructure genNat
  f <- genFin n
  pure (n ** f)
```

In this case, `alternativesOf` being applied to `genAnyFin'' @{elements [1, 2]}` would return a single alternative.

<!-- idris
main_genAnyFin_alternatives_count_corr : IO ()
main_genAnyFin_alternatives_count_corr = putStrLn $ show $ length (alternativesOf $ genAnyFin @{elements [1, 2]}) == 2

main_genAnyFin''_alternatives_count_corr : IO ()
main_genAnyFin''_alternatives_count_corr = putStrLn $ show $ length (alternativesOf $ genAnyFin'' @{elements [1, 2]}) == 1
-->

Also, here you can see that we can use generators as `auto`-parameters,
thus no need in a separate thing like QuickCheck's `Arbitrary`.

You can also see that having a dependent type to generate,
we can consider different ratio between given and generated type arguments.
Technically speaking, `Fin n` and `(n ** Fin n)` are different types,
but pragmatically, `genFin` and `genAnyFin` both generate elements of type `Fin n`,
but the first one takes `n` as a given value,
and the second one generates value for the type argument along with the main value.

You can read more on the design of generators in [documentation](https://deptycheck.readthedocs.io/en/lastest/explanation/generators/).

## Derivation of generators

<!-- idris
%hint
UsedConstructorDerivator : ConstructorDerivator
UsedConstructorDerivator = LeastEffort
-->

DepTyCheck supports automatic derivation of generators using the datatype definition.

For now, it is not tunable at all, however, it is planned to be added.

Derived generators are total.
Since for now generators are finite,
it was decided to use explicit fuel pattern to support recursive data types.
For simplicity, fuel pattern is used for all derived generators.

To invoke derivation, we use `deriveGen` macro:

```idris
genNat : Fuel -> Gen Nat
genNat = deriveGen
```

It uses very powerful metaprogramming facility of Idris 2 programming language
for analysing the data structure which generator is derived for and producing code of the asked generator at compile time.
This facility is called *elaborator reflection*, and you can find some kind of tutorial for this
[here](https://github.com/stefan-hoeck/idris2-elab-util/blob/main/src/Doc/Index.md).
To enable it, you have to add `%language ElabReflection` to the source code before the first call to the macro.

However, beware of possible high resources consumption of this stage.
In our non-trivial examples, derivation may take several hours and tens of gigabytes of memory.
We work for improvements of this, however we hope that
[new core](https://github.com/edwinb/Yaffle/) of the Idris compiler would solve this issue completely.

Of course, we do not support all possible dependent types.
For example, for now, we do not support type-polymorphic types and
GADTs which have function calls in type indices of their constructors.
However, we are constantly working for widening supported types.

<!-- Example of non-trivial derivation should go here -->

More on design of derivator can be found in [documentation](https://deptycheck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanation/derivation/).

## Usage and installation

We try to use as fresh version of the Idris 2 compiler as possible.
The version we test against is in the file called [`.idris-version`](/.idris-version) in the root of this repository.

Derivation facility of this library has en external dependency to the [`idris2-elab-util`](https://github.com/stefan-hoeck/idris2-elab-util/) package.
In order to run tests, you will also need [`idris2-sop`](https://github.com/stefan-hoeck/idris2-sop) package.

For building, installing and testing we have a makefile, thus we use simple old `make` utility to do this.
Installation is done with a built-in facility of the Idris 2 compiler,
so consult to [its documentation](https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/packages.html?highlight=--install#using-package-files)
to see where the library is installed.
